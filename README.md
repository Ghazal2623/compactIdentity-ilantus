# Billing and Reports Modules

## About This Project
This project shows simple Java programs I made for the **Compact Identity** system for Ilantus client in my organization.  
The goal was to make billing and reporting easier and faster.

## What I Did
- Created the **Billing Module** to make invoices, track payments, and manage client billing automatically.  
- Built the **Reports Module** to make sales reports and summaries from the invoices.  
- Connected these parts so they work together to handle billing and reporting.  

## Whatâ€™s Inside this repo - 

### BillingModule.java
- Creates and stores invoices for clients.  
- Lets you record when a payment is made.  
- Shows a list of all invoices.

### ReportsModule.java
- Makes reports about sales based on the invoices.  
- Counts paid and unpaid invoices and totals amounts.

### Main.java
- Example program that uses the Billing and Reports modules.  
- Shows how to create invoices, mark payments, and print reports.
